This is an essay about a productivity spreadsheet. Everyone has their own way of doing things — this one has worked for me. Maybe it's helpful for you too.<br><br>

The long and short of the story is that I used to email myself a bunch of to-dos. Posts and papers to read. Videos to watch. Reminders. I had time over winter break to break the cycle — I went through my email and moved everything into a spreadsheet with four main columns. Their labels are "Offense (business)" "Defense (admin)" "Mental Health (soul)" & "Physical Health".<br><br>

These all have subcategories — Under offense, there's a section called "House" (I'd like to own one someday). There are also TKTK. Under defense there's less "fun" things which I should probably do like reorganizing my passwords. Mental Health has things like books I want to read. Physical health has things like Michael Jordan's how-to basketball video.<br><br>
