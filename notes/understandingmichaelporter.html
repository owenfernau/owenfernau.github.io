This was my first book on business strategy. I really enjoyed it. 

A key framing that stuck out to me was to conceive of a business as a series of "activities" which, when strung together, provide value to someone. It sounds simple, and it is, but conceiving of a business as a chain of activities, each link of which can be optimized individually and based on interdependence to others, was insightful to me. 

Another concept which stuck out to me was that companys should be judged based on return on invested capital. This comes as opposed to stock price, TK, or TK. Again, that's useful. It's easy to be distracted by 

Understanding that you have to make tradeoffs was another key insight for me - a business should explicitly say who they won't serve. That allows it to optimize who they will. 

As always, depending on your prior knowledge and experiences, this book may prove less or more valuable. For me, it was worth a read.
