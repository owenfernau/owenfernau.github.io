	<p>
		- Hi, I'm a writer branching out into operations, investing, and design.
		<br><br>
		- Currently running editorial operations for <a href="http://www.ournetwork.xyz/">OurNetwork</a>, a media organization focused on onchain data.
		<br><br>
		- made my first angel investment in <a href="https://www.graph.cx/">Graph</a>, the common thread finder, in Dec. 2024.
		<br><br>
		- wrote as a reporter for <a href="https://thedefiant.io/">The Defiant</a>, a crypto-media company, from 2021-2024.
		<br><br>
		- dropped out of college after my freshman year, moved to Philadelphia and then New York during time away from school. Did some "menial" jobs while I figured stuff out. 
		<br><br>
		- read a lot (too many?) books in my time away from school - realized action matters more...
		<br><br>
		- went back to school for economics + took two years of Japanese and studied abroad in Tokyo. でもゆっくり日本語を忘れっています...
		<br><br>
		- 🏀, ♟️, and learning to play 🎵 are my primary hobbies. 
		<br><br>
